if you can read this i think it might be working.
in github, click the green button that says code, then click on codespaces, and open solid dollop (i need to figure out how to change it.)
to save a file after you have eddited it, click the source control button on the left that looks like a weird y with circles on the ends. the click the green commit button to upload it.
it will open up a new tab called COMMIT_EDITMSG. in the very first line, type something simple like "changed Index.py" which will show up under the source control graph. click the checkmark in the top right to fully commit.
